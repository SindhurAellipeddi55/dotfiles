## Also look for cozier options like Alt-Z or Alt-X
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix


# split panes using | and -
## Intuitive picture of the splits
bind \| split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
unbind '"'
unbind %


# Enable mouse control (clickable windows, panes, resizable panes)
set -g mouse on
